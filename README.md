# text-invaders-migrations


Through dark sunken eyes

I see another pale sunrise

surrounded by soldiers

glued to the screens

hold back the invaders

their infernal machines.

We fight to survive

running to stay alive

our bodies aching and tired

there's no where to hide

our covers' been blown away

Space Invaders

Space Invaders ooooooooooh

They're closing in on me

dark forces cold and unseen

Oh my hip pocket nerve is aching again

I must go back in and fight it out to the end

(musical interlude, more space invader sound effects)

They're closing in on me

dark forces cold and unseen

Oh my hip pocket nerve is aching again

I must go back in and fight it out the end.

We fight to survive

running to stay alive

our bodies aching and tired

there's no where to hide

our covers been blown away
